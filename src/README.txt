How to set up and run the application:
    - GITHUB: https://github.com/erikri11/distribution-innovation
    - npn start
    - npm test

How I approached the solution:
    - I startet making an reguestUtils.tsx file, and made a API helper function called "loadData".
    - I then created the necessary interfaces.
    - I then started retrieving data from the API and building the solution.

What I f.ex would improve:
    - I could have validated what values ​​the user actually entered into the fields.
    - I could have included the entrance and not just the street name.
